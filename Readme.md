# Description of this portfolio website

## Purpose

The purpose of this personal portfolio is to present what skills and understandings I have of HTML5 and CSS coding. This personal portfolio will be a great example showing what I have learnt in the past 5 weeks through CoderAcademy. It will also include some insight into who I am as a person and why I would be great asset to a Webdesign/Web development company.

## Functionality/Features

Started off with choosing a background color and created a header. Created a folder for CSS styling to change the font size and font family of the header. The navigation was also input into the header, gave it some width along with display flex to justify the positioning of each Navigation Links.
